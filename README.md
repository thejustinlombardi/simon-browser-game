- As a player, I want my game to be able to have access to the rules of the game so I understand how to play the game.

- As a player, I want to see which round I'm on and what my score is so I can keep track of where I stand.
- As a player, I want to be able to stop and start the game when I choose to so I can continue or start over.
- As a player, I want my game to light up on the colored buttons to mimic the real game so you can see each move Simon and I make.
