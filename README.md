### Unsolved Problems / Major Hurdles

- The biggest hurdle I faced was getting the timing right for the colors and sound to display properly. Timeout functions and changing playback rates were implemented to allow for proper functionality.

### Attributes/Thank You

First, I would like to thank my instructors and classmates at GA for all of their help when I was hitting walls. For my first game, I'm very proud of the end result and cannot wait to make improvements to this one! I also want to thank my fianc√© for being my 'Rubberduck' when I was working through the logic! 'Til the next game!
